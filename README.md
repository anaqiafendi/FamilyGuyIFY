I want to make a machine learning model which when fed an image, it will reproduce that image in the style of FamilyGuy.

There is an artist who already does this by hand. If I can use a transformer such as OpenAIs GPT-3, I can get a few samples from the artist
and train the model on that. This project might take a long time however because there are a lot of considerations to make, such as
edge detection methods, etc.
